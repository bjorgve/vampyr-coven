Setting up your system
======================

To use the VAMPyR Python package, you have two main options: working online or setting up your local environment.

For online access, `Binder <https://mybinder.org>`_ allows you to run the Jupyter notebooks in the cloud without any local setup.

For local use, setting up your Python environment correctly is crucial. The `Conda package and environment manager <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/>`_ is recommended for installing binary packages, including VAMPyR, in an isolated and reproducible software environment.

For installation instructions, please refer to the VAMPyR GitHub repository:

Install Miniconda
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To install Miniconda, follow the official `Miniconda installation instructions <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html>`_.
